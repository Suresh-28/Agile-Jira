AGILE:

*Agile is an approach to software development under which requiremnets and  solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross - functional teams and their customer/end user.
*Both development and testing activities are concurrent unlike the waterfall model.
AGILE TEAM: It is a collection of multiple like testers ,developers,product manager,etc.. will be the part.
* In this ,  the role is not important the task is important like no seniors and juniors everybody will fall under the same.
* In agile process developing and testing goes parallel.
*Whenever a client need to change any requirments , we can esaily accommodate those requirements.

TERMINOLOGIES[EPIC,STORY,TASK]:

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT: which contains the requirements which are specified by the customer.
*In the agile process documentation required will be avoided 90%.
*The epic and stories are derived by product owner/scrum master.
EPIC: epic is a large requirement define the business needs[ONLINE BANKING]
STORY: It is a smaller requirement [LOGIN,TRANSFER MONEY, CHECK BALANCE]
TASK: 
Review the story
Estinate the story
Desugn
Code
Unit Testing
Intefration Testing
etc..

QA:
Review the story 
Test Cases
Test Scenarios
Test data
Reviews
Test Environment
Report Bugs
etc..

AGILE ROLES:
PRODUCT OWNER: he is aperson responsible for getting the requirements from the customer.
*define the features of the product
*decide on release date and content
*prioritize features according to market value
*adjust features and priority every iteration ,as needed
*accept or rejecr work results.

SCRUM MASTER: who is factilitator the complete agile process.
*Enable close cooperation across all roles and functions.

SCRUM TEAM: developers and testers should work together to get the deliver.

DOR(DEFINATION OF READY): 
*user story is clear.
*user story is testable
*user story is feasible
*user story defined
*user story acceptance criteria defined
*user story dependencies identified
*user story sized by development team
*scrum team accepts user experience artefacts.
*performance criteria identifed ,where appropriate
*scalability criteria identified ,where approprite
*security criteria identified, where appropriate
*person who will accept the story is identified
*Team has a good idea what it will mean to demo the user story.

DOD(DEFINATION OF DONE):
*code produced(all to doitems in code completed)
*code commented ,checked inand run against current version in source 
*Relevant documentation.diagrams produced and / or updated.

PRODUCT BACKLOG: It is prepared by prodct owner and which contains the requiremnets.[contains complete stories]
SPRINT/ITERATION: time interval to complete a task one version of software.
SPRINT BACKLOG: contains the commited storys

STEPS:
1.product owner: cerate baclog
*sprint:Time interval
*Story Point: developers and QA give estimation for the specific story.
* Estimation gives in the fibonaccci series 
2.Meeting
3.Sprint Backlog: sprint interval, evaryday scrum meeting[15min]
4.finished work[sprint review, sprint retrospective]

ADVANTAGES OF AGILE SCRUM:
*we can save time and cost of the project.
*the quality can be ensured because each and every sprint will be tested multiple times.
*The requirements change can be accepted at any level of the project maintenanace.
*All the participating in scrum meting so that transparency can be maintained.
*Each and every sprint we are delivering to the client so we can maintain the customer satisfaction and we can avoid deliveryrisk  of the project.


----------------------JIRA TOOL---------------------------------

Managing agile process
        *create backlogs
         *create sprints
         *tasks
         * update story status scrum board
write test cases
Execute test cases update of the test cases


AGILE SCRUM ACTIVITIES:
1.How to install and configure JIRA Tool

2.How to create project in Jira
sigin > create new project > select template [scrum] > create

3.How to add users/people in Jira
Jira setting > invite user

[backlog are created while doing the projects]

4.How to create  User stories in Jira
Baclog page > create > by default story is selected > add summary feature/title > add issue > create.
[update the sprint points in every story]

5.Creating sprint in Jira
Backlog page > create sprint

6.Adding user stories to sprint
Backlog > drag and drop story into Sprint.

7.starting sprint
Backlog > start sprint

8.adding sub tasks to story
Board > click story > add child issuse.

9.sprint life cycle in Jira
10.creating bugs in Jira

TEST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES:

Pre -requisites:
1)Dashboard > apps > explore > search > Zephyr > try
2)Adding issue type > project settings > Issue types > add new issuse > type "test".
